# copy-on-write-friendly GC but can cause bad things to happen when
# resources like sockets are opened at load time by the master
# process and shared by multiple children.  People enabling this are
# highly encouraged to look at the before_fork/after_fork hooks to
# properly close/reopen sockets.  Files opened for logging do not
# have to be reopened as (unbuffered-in-userspace) files opened with
# the File::APPEND flag are written to atomically on UNIX.
